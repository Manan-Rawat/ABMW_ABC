# ABWM-ABC

Adaptive Bayesian Walk Model via Approximate Bayesian Computation

A unified framework for likelihood-free Bayesian model selection and parameter inference that combines:
- Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
- Adaptive model exploration inspired by RJMCMC

## Key Features
- Simultaneous model selection and parameter inference
- No likelihood calculations required
- Adaptive computational resource allocation
- Works with simulation-based models
